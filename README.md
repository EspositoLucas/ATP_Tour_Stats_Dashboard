# ATP_Tour_Stats_Dashboard 🎾

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the prime years of the legendary tennis players Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal (The Big 3). The analysis compares their performances during their respective peak years to determine who had the best performance in their prime. Python is used for Web Scrapping, Excel for data analysis and Power BI is employed for visualizing key insights.  

## Project Structure  

- **[notebooks](notebooks/):**  
  - Contains Jupyter notebooks performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical comparisons of the players' performances.  

- **[dataset](dataset/):**  
  - Includes the dataset with detailed match statistics for Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal during their peak years.  

- **[assets](assets/):**  
  - Resources such as charts, player images, or supplementary files used in presentations or dashboards.  

- **Power BI Dashboard:**  
  - `players_dashboard.pbix`: An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing comparative performance metrics like win percentages, titles, and match statistics.  

## Objectives  
- 🏆 **Prime Era Identification:** Analyze the data to pinpoint each player's peak years (e.g., Federer’s 2005-2006, Nadal’s 2010-2013, Djokovic’s 2011-2015).  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics Comparison:** Compare metrics like win rates, titles won, and dominance against top 10 opponents.  
- 🎯 **Visual Insights:** Provide compelling visualizations to help identify trends and key differences.  

## How to Use  

1. **Notebooks:**  
   - Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" folder.  
   - Ensure Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed.  

2. **Dataset:**  
   - Data files in the "dataset" folder contain crucial match statistics.  
   - Avoid altering the folder structure to ensure reproducibility.  

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Open `dashboard.pptx` file .  
   - Interact with the dashboard to explore visual insights.
